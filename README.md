# MEAN

One more pratice project using MEAN. If you don't know nothing about MEAN.

MEAN: It's the meaning of: MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js

I have been praticing in my free time, I'm not expert and it is really interesting working with it. 

Node.js comes in a good time. For those that looking for scalable aproaches, Node.js is a right choice!

This example is about a "City Register", create a document (Save) and get all documents (Find), simple it! 

Enjoy!
